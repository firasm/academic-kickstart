title: Oxygen-enhanced MRI
summary: Using a cycling gas challenge and independent component analysis (ICA), we improved the sensitivity and speed of existing oxygen enhanced MRI techniques to detect changes in oxygenation. Using ICA and adding a cycling gas challenge extends the sensitivity of OE‚ÄêMRI and allows the oxygenation status of tumors to be assessed in as little as six minutes.
