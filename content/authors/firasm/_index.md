I am a teaching and learning fellow in the Master of Data Science program at the University of British Columbia.
I received my PhD in Physics from the Reinsberg lab in 2019 (also at UBC) where among other things, I developed a new MRI technique to assess the oxygenation status of tumours using independent component analysis (ICA).
During my PhD I got interested in data science, learning analytics, and science communication and that led me to learn more about statistical techniques such as ICA and data visualization using dashboards and effective plotting.
